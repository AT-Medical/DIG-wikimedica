This address is used for:
- GitHub organisation membership (the GitHub account should be associated with this email)
- Nextcloud access
- Editorial communications
- Official attribution in article metadata (optional — authors may use their institutional email for attribution if preferred)

The email account is deactivated when a contributor's access is revoked (voluntary departure, prolonged inactivity > 18 months without communication, or policy violation).

- **Editorial communications**: Shared folders for in-progress reviews, editorial decisions, meeting notes
- **Asset storage**: Approved images, diagrams, and media for articles (before publication to MediaWiki)

Nextcloud access uses SSO with the AT Medical identity provider. Credentials are the same as the `@wikimedica.de` email account.
