## What is Wikimedica?

**Wikimedica** (wikimedica.de) is a German-language medical knowledge platform developed and maintained by **AT Medical Digital Solutions**. It serves three core audiences:

- **Healthcare professionals** — structured, guideline-aligned clinical articles with references, ICD-10 codes, and versioned update history.
- **Patients** — plain-language explanations of diagnoses, procedures, and medications at an accessible reading level.
- **Clinical teams** — modular consent forms (*Aufklärungsbögen*), discharge instructions, and wound-care guides that clinics can brand and deploy via QR code.

Wikimedica is **not** a copy of existing encyclopaedias. Every article is independently authored, peer-reviewed by specialty-qualified medical professionals, and released under a Creative Commons licence.

### Flagship Focus: Gender-Medizin

Gender-Medizin (sex- and gender-sensitive medicine) is a cross-cutting editorial priority. Articles across all specialties are evaluated for sex- and gender-disaggregated evidence, and a dedicated Gender-Medizin specialty area publishes original content on this topic.

## Content Model

Content is organised into the following types:

| Type | Description | Audience |
|---|---|---|
| Professional Article | Guideline-aligned clinical articles | Physicians, nurses, pharmacists |
| Patient Article | Plain-language disease/procedure explanations | Patients, caregivers |
| Consent Module | Modular *Aufklärungsbögen* for procedures | Patients + clinical staff |
| Discharge Module | Post-discharge instructions and wound care | Patients + clinical staff |
| Pharmaka | Structured drug information | Physicians, pharmacists |
| Therapy | Evidence-based therapy protocols | Physicians |

All content lives in `content/` as Markdown files with YAML frontmatter. Templates are in `content/templates/`.

### Specialty Taxonomy

Wikimedica covers 26 clinical specialty areas:

Innere Medizin · Kardiologie · Pneumologie · Gastroenterologie · Nephrologie · Endokrinologie/Diabetologie · Hämatologie/Onkologie · Infektiologie · Rheumatologie · Neurologie · Psychiatrie · Dermatologie · Pädiatrie · Gynäkologie/Geburtshilfe · Urologie · Orthopädie/Unfallchirurgie · Anästhesiologie · Intensivmedizin · Notfallmedizin · Chirurgie · Radiologie · Labormedizin · Pharmakologie · Palliativmedizin · Prävention/Public Health · Gender-Medizin

---

## Editorial Model

All content follows a structured lifecycle:

```
Draft → Peer Review → Editorial Review → Medical Advisor Sign-off → Published
```

Key principles:

- Every article requires at least one peer review by a **specialty-qualified reviewer**.
- Medical advisors sign off on articles in high-risk areas (drug dosing, emergency medicine, oncology protocols).
- Articles are flagged for review when new AWMF/ESC guidelines are published or when PubMed surveillance identifies significant new evidence.
- AI-assisted drafting is permitted but must be declared in the article metadata and requires full human review.

See [`docs/editorial/editorial-governance.md`](docs/editorial/editorial-governance.md) for the full governance document.

---

## GitHub as Source of Truth

GitHub is the **canonical source** for all Wikimedica content and infrastructure configuration. This means:

- Every article, policy, and configuration file lives in this repository.
- All changes go through Pull Requests with required reviewers.
- Article status is tracked in YAML frontmatter (`draft`, `in-review`, `approved`, `published`, `archived`).
- The PubMed surveillance workflow commits results directly to `data/pubmed/` and opens Issues for editorial follow-up.
- Guideline review reminders are generated as GitHub Issues on a monthly schedule.
- Deployments are triggered by tagged releases on `main` via GitHub Actions.

CODEOWNERS (`.github/CODEOWNERS`) enforce that changes to `docs/`, `content/`, and `infra/` require approval from the respective team.

---

## Deployment Model

| Component | Technology |
|---|---|
| Hosting | VPS (KVM, Debian/Ubuntu) |
| Reverse Proxy | Traefik v3 |
| TLS | Let's Encrypt via Cloudflare DNS-01 challenge |
| DNS / CDN | Cloudflare |
| Application | MediaWiki (latest LTS) |
| Database | MariaDB 10.11+ |
| Container Runtime | Docker Compose |

Deployments are executed by `infra/deploy/deploy.sh` on the VPS, triggered via SSH from a GitHub Actions workflow on tagged release pushes to `main`.

See [`docs/deployment/deployment-model.md`](docs/deployment/deployment-model.md) and `infra/` for full details.

---

## PubMed Surveillance

A daily GitHub Actions workflow (`scripts/pubmed/pubmed-daily-search.py`) queries the NCBI PubMed API using specialty-specific search strategies defined in `scripts/pubmed/search-terms.yaml`. Results are:

1. Normalised and stored as JSONL in `data/pubmed/`.
2. Classified for relevance (stub model — to be extended with ML).
3. Mapped to Wikimedica specialties.
4. Actioned automatically:
   - **High relevance** → GitHub Issue opened for editorial review.
   - **Medium relevance** → Logged for monthly review.
   - **Low relevance** → Stored but no action.

Gender-Medizin has an expanded search term set reflecting the flagship priority.

See [`docs/pubmed/pubmed-surveillance-architecture.md`](docs/pubmed/pubmed-surveillance-architecture.md).

# Wikimedica

**Structured Medical Knowledge and Patient Education Platform**

Wikimedica is a modular, AI-assisted medical knowledge, patient education, and consent platform developed by **AT Medical Digital Solutions**.

It is designed to combine structured medical content, editorial governance, AI-supported review workflows, and GitHub-driven publishing preparation into a scalable medical knowledge ecosystem.

---

## Vision

To create a modern, structured, and continuously reviewable medical knowledge platform for both healthcare professionals and patients.

---

## Core Areas

Wikimedica is being prepared as a modular knowledge system covering areas such as:

- diseases / Erkrankungen
- therapies / Therapien

- patient education
- consent modules / Aufklärungsbögen
- discharge and aftercare
- guideline summaries
- QR-linked media and explanatory content

---

## Core Principles

- **Human review before publication**
- **AI as support, not autonomous publisher**
- **Structured editorial governance**
- **Evidence-aware content development**
- **Separation of professional and patient-friendly language layers**
- **Future-ready for public platform deployment**

---

## Repository Role

This repository is the operational backbone for the future Wikimedica platform and is intended to host:

- content architecture
- editorial governance
- review workflows
- source tracking
- PubMed surveillance preparation
