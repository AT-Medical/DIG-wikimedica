# Source Tracking — Wikimedica

This directory maintains records of external sources registered for use in Wikimedica content. Source tracking ensures transparency, copyright compliance, and systematic quality monitoring.

---

## Purpose

Every external source referenced in a Wikimedica article must be registered here if it is used beyond a simple PMID citation. This includes: guidelines, textbooks, databases, and any source subject to specific licence or copyright restrictions.

## Source Registration

### How to Register a Source

1. Add an entry to the appropriate YAML file in this directory (see file structure below).
2. Include all required fields (see schema below).
3. Submit via Pull Request to `main`.
4. An editor will review the source registration for copyright compliance.

### File Structure

```

## Source Quality Scoring

Sources are assessed for quality using the following dimensions:

| Dimension | Description | Score (1–5) |
|---|---|---|
| Evidence quality | Level of evidence (RCT, meta-analysis, observational, expert opinion) | 1–5 |
| Currency | How recently was this source published or updated? | 1–5 |
| Issuer authority | Issuer's standing (major learned society, peer-reviewed journal, etc.) | 1–5 |
| German-context relevance | Applicability to German healthcare system and population | 1–5 |
| Accessibility | Is the full source freely accessible? | 1–5 |

Source quality scores inform the evidence grading in articles and are used by the PubMed surveillance pipeline's relevance classifier.
