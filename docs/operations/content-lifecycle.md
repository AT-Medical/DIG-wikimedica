## 1. Overview

This document describes the complete lifecycle of a Wikimedica article — from initial proposal through drafting, review, publication, ongoing maintenance, and eventual archival. It also defines the versioning model, update triggers, content scoring approach, and quality metrics.

## 3. Versioning Model

Articles use **semantic versioning** (`MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`):

| Change Type | Version Bump | Review Required |
|---|---|---|
| Typographical / formatting fix | PATCH (x.x.1) | No (Editor only) |
| New references, minor factual additions | MINOR (x.1.0) | Peer review |
| New sections, significant clinical updates | MINOR (x.1.0) | Peer review |
| Complete rewrite, major guideline-driven revision | MAJOR (1.0.0 → 2.0.0) | Full review cycle |
| Retraction of incorrect clinical information | MAJOR | Medical Advisor sign-off |

Version history is tracked in Git commit history. The current version is always present in the `version` field of the article frontmatter.

---

## 4. Update Triggers

An article may enter a new revision cycle for the following reasons:

### 4.1 Guideline Update

- A guideline referenced in the article has been updated or superseded.
- Detected via: monthly guideline registry review (`scripts/reporting/monthly-guideline-report.py`).
- Response time: 30 days (high priority) or next quarterly cycle (standard priority), per AMPIS score.

### 4.2 PubMed Alert

- A PubMed surveillance alert of `HIGH` or `MEDIUM` relevance has been generated for the article's topic.
- Detected via: daily PubMed surveillance (`scripts/pubmed/pubmed-daily-search.py`).
- Response time: 7 days (HIGH), 30 days (MEDIUM).

### 4.3 Editorial Flag

- An editor or reviewer identifies an inaccuracy, safety concern, or significant gap in published content.
- Any Wikimedica contributor or reader (via the MediaWiki "report issue" function, future) can flag content for review.
- An immediate review is triggered when a safety concern is raised.

### 4.4 Stale Detection

- Article has not been reviewed in 12 months.
- Detected via: `scripts/review/generate-review-report.py` (monthly run).
- Response: GitHub Issue opened; author notified with 30-day response window.

### 4.5 External Report

- Reader, patient, or third-party organisation reports an error.
- All external reports are triaged by the Editorial Board within 5 business days.

---

## 5. Archival Policy

An article is archived when:

- It has been **superseded** by a more comprehensive or updated version.
- The clinical topic is **no longer relevant** (withdrawn procedure, obsolete diagnosis).
- The content was **retracted** due to clinical error or copyright violation.
- The article has been **inactive for 24 months** with no update activity despite automated prompts.

### Archival Process

1. Editor changes `status` to `archived` in frontmatter.
2. Article is moved to `content/archived/` (future: Git branching strategy).
3. MediaWiki page is updated with an archival notice pointing to any replacement article.
4. Git history is preserved; content is never deleted from the repository.

## 6. Content Scoring

Every published article is assigned a **Content Quality Score (CQS)** — a composite indicator used to prioritise editorial review and identify articles needing improvement.

### CQS Dimensions

| Dimension | Weight | Description |
|---|---|---|
| Completeness | 25% | All required frontmatter fields and sections present |
| Reference Quality | 25% | Proportion of claims backed by S3/S2 guidelines or RCTs |
| Currency | 20% | Days since last review (normalised; penalises staleness) |
| Review Depth | 15% | Number of distinct qualified reviewers |
| Readability | 15% | Flesch-Kincaid or equivalent score (appropriate to article type) |

CQS is calculated by `scripts/review/generate-review-report.py` and reported in the monthly review dashboard.

## 7. Quality Metrics

The Editorial Board tracks the following platform-level quality metrics:

| Metric | Target | Measurement Frequency |
|---|---|---|
| % articles with `published` status that are current (not stale) | ≥ 90% | Monthly |
| Average review turnaround time (standard) | ≤ 14 days | Monthly |
| % articles with ≥ 2 reviewers | ≥ 60% | Quarterly |
| % high-risk articles with Medical Advisor sign-off | 100% | Monthly |
| PubMed HIGH alerts actioned within 7 days | ≥ 80% | Monthly |
| Guideline updates reflected within 30 days (high priority) | ≥ 90% | Monthly |
| Author CoI declarations up to date | 100% | Annually |

These metrics are reported in the annual editorial report and used to inform resource allocation and process improvements.
